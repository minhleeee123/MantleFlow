## 🎬 SECTION 1: Introduction + Problem (45 seconds)

### Visual: Landing page of MantleFlow

**[0:00 - 0:45]**

> "Hello! I'm [Your Name] from [Team Name], and today I'm excited to introduce **MantleFlow** - a next-generation decentralized trading wallet platform built on Mantle Network.
>
> In today's DeFi ecosystem, users face three major challenges: complex wallet management, lack of transparency in trading operations, and fragmented user experiences across multiple platforms. Traditional wallets are either too simple for serious traders or too complicated for newcomers.
>
> MantleFlow solves this by providing an intelligent, all-in-one trading wallet with seamless smart contract integration, real-time portfolio tracking, and an intuitive interface that makes DeFi accessible to everyone."

> **Third**, real-time portfolio tracking and transaction history, so you always know exactly what's happening with your assets.
>
> **And fourth**, an intelligent trading system that executes operations securely through your personal smart contract wallet.

## 🚀 SECTION 3: Live Demo (4 minutes 30 seconds)

### **DEMO PART 1: Wallet Connection & Setup (1 minute)**

**[2:00 - 3:00]**

#### Visual: Homepage → Connect Wallet

> "Let's start from the beginning. When you first visit MantleFlow, you're greeted by our clean, modern interface with our 3D mascot.
>
> To get started, I'll click **'Connect Wallet'** in the top right corner."

#### Visual: MetaMask popup appears

> "The platform integrates with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets. I'm currently connected to Mantle Sepolia testnet for this demo.
>
> Once connected, notice how the UI instantly updates - showing my wallet address and the '**Get Started**' button."

#### Visual: Click "Get Started" → Navigate to Dashboard

> "Now I'll click **'Get Started'** to access the main dashboard.
>
> And here we are! This is the MantleFlow Dashboard - your command center for all trading operations."

---

### **DEMO PART 2: Dashboard Overview (45 seconds)**

**[3:00 - 3:45]**

#### Visual: Point out key dashboard elements

> "Let me give you a quick tour of what you're seeing:
>
> At the top, we have our navigation bar with four main sections: **Portfolio**, **Trade**, **History**, and **Settings**.
>
> In the center, there's the **Portfolio Overview** showing your total balance, available funds, and assets in different wallets.
>
> Below that, you'll see your **Recent Transactions** with real-time status updates.
>
> And on the right side, we have **Quick Actions** - the fastest way to deposit, withdraw, or execute trades.
>
> Everything is designed for speed and clarity. Now let's interact with the platform."

---

### **DEMO PART 3: Creating/Accessing Smart Contract Wallet (1 minute)**

**[3:45 - 4:45]**

#### Visual: Navigate to Wallet section or show wallet creation flow

> "The heart of MantleFlow is your personal smart contract wallet. Let me show you how this works.
>
> When you first use MantleFlow, the platform checks if you already have a smart contract wallet deployed through our WalletFactory contract."

#### Visual: Show smart contract wallet interface

> "In my case, I already have a wallet created - you can see the contract address here: **[show address]**.
>
> This isn't just a regular wallet - it's a smart contract deployed on Mantle Network that only YOU control. This gives you the security of a multi-sig wallet with the simplicity of a standard wallet.
>
> For new users, creating a wallet is just one click. The WalletFactory contract deploys a new TradingWallet instance specifically for you. The transaction typically completes in seconds thanks to Mantle's fast block times.
>
> You can see important details here: your wallet balance, the contract address, and options to deposit or withdraw funds. Let's do a deposit now."

---

### **DEMO PART 4: Deposit Flow (1 minute)**

**[4:45 - 5:45]**

#### Visual: Click Deposit button

> "I'll click on **'Deposit'** to add some MNT to my trading wallet.
>
> A modal appears with a clean interface. I'll enter the amount - let's deposit **0.5 MNT**."

#### Visual: Enter amount, click confirm

> "Notice the interface shows me the exact amount I'm depositing and calculates the estimated gas fees in real-time.
>
> I'll click **'Confirm Deposit'**."

#### Visual: MetaMask popup

> "MetaMask prompts me to approve the transaction. The gas fees on Mantle are incredibly low - you can see it's just a fraction of what you'd pay on Ethereum mainnet.
>
> I'll confirm..."

#### Visual: Transaction processing → Success

> "And watch what happens. The transaction is submitted to the Mantle Network...
>
> Processing...
>
> And **success!** In just a few seconds, 0.5 MNT has been deposited into my smart contract wallet.
>
> Notice how the balance updates automatically - both in the wallet overview and in the portfolio section. Everything is real-time and transparent."

---

### **DEMO PART 5: Transaction History & Transparency (45 seconds)**

**[5:45 - 6:30]**

#### Visual: Navigate to History tab

> "One of the most important features of MantleFlow is complete transparency. Let me show you the **Transaction History** section.
>
> Here you can see every single transaction that's occurred through your smart contract wallet - deposits, withdrawals, trades - everything is recorded.
>
> For each transaction, you get:
> - The transaction type and amount
> - Timestamp
> - Status (pending, completed, or failed)
> - And most importantly, the transaction hash
>
> Click on any transaction hash, and it takes you directly to the Mantle block explorer where you can verify everything on-chain. This is complete transparency and trust through verification."

---

### **DEMO PART 6: Withdrawal Flow (Quick demonstration - 30 seconds)**

**[6:30 - 7:00]**

#### Visual: Navigate back, click Withdraw

> "Withdrawing is just as simple. Let me quickly demonstrate.
>
> I'll click **'Withdraw'**, enter an amount - let's do **0.1 MNT** - and confirm.
>
> The smart contract processes the withdrawal request, MetaMask asks for confirmation, and within seconds, the funds are transferred back to my main wallet.
>
> The entire process is seamless, secure, and fast."

---

## 🌐 SECTION 4: Mantle Integration Highlights (30 seconds)

**[7:00 - 7:30]**

#### Visual: Show contract addresses or deployment info

> "What makes MantleFlow special is how deeply we've integrated with Mantle Network.
>
> We have two main smart contracts deployed on Mantle Sepolia:
> - Our **WalletFactory** contract that creates individual trading wallets
> - And the **TradingWallet** contract template that each user gets
>
> By building on Mantle, we leverage:
> - **Ultra-low gas fees** - making frequent trading viable
> - **Fast block times** - for near-instant transaction confirmation
> - **EVM compatibility** - allowing us to use battle-tested Solidity patterns
> - And **Mantle's growing ecosystem** - positioning MantleFlow at the heart of the next DeFi wave
>
> Thank you for watching! MantleFlow - making DeFi simple, secure, and accessible on Mantle Network."

## 📋 Director's Notes

### Pacing Tips:
- **Keep energy high** during the demo sections
- **Pause briefly** after each action to let viewers see the UI update
- **Point with cursor** to highlight specific UI elements
- **Speak clearly** and maintain steady pace

### Technical Requirements:
- **Screen resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
- **Browser zoom**: 100% (ensure UI elements are clearly visible)
- **Hide browser bookmarks bar** for clean recording
- **Prepare test MNT** in wallet beforehand
- **Test entire flow** 2-3 times before recording

### Backup Plans:
- If transaction is slow: *"While we wait for confirmation, let me show you..."*
- If MetaMask doesn't pop up: Have it pre-opened in another tab
- If any error occurs: Have a pre-recorded backup clip ready

### What to Show on Screen:
- **Landing page** - highlight 3D mascot and clean design
- **Dashboard** - show portfolio overview
- **Wallet interface** - smart contract address visible
- **Transaction modals** - deposit/withdraw forms
- **MetaMask confirmations** - show low gas fees
- **Success messages** - celebrate completed transactions
- **History page** - show transaction records
- **Block explorer** (optional) - verify on-chain

### Post-Production:
- Add **background music** (soft, energetic)
- Add **text overlays** for key points (smart contract addresses, features)
- Add **zoom-in effects** on important UI actions
- Add **transitions** between major sections
- Add **Mantle Network logo** and **team logo** at start/end
